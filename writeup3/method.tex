\begin{document}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
Filtering theory
\begin{enumerate}
\item
The standard reference for the Unscented Kalman Filter and joint/dual estimation. \cite{wan2000unscented}
When the model is partially linear (as in our case), we can use reduced sigma point filtering to improve speed with no loss in accuracy.
\cite{morelande2006reduced}
We can also improve speed by using a low rank approximation of the covariance matrix.
\cite{padilla2010adaptive}

\item
There exist good filtering methods for designing Unknown Input Observers (UIOs).
\cite{yang1988observers,bolandhemmat2012solution,witczak2014unknown}
Using one of these methods, we can estimate the control input for our system,
then apply the previous techniques to detect attacks.
The UIO technique introduces extra overhead steps, however.
My technique estimates the attack directly without needing to first estimate the control input.
\end{enumerate}

\item
Filtering to estimate states in a power grid
\begin{enumerate}
\item
All of these papers are for estimating the parameters of a single generator connected to an idealized powergrid.
This paper claims that the UKF is better than the EKF for estimating the rotor angle and speed in synchronous generators.
The authors use a fourth-order nonlinear model of a single motor generator with an infinite bus.
No joint estimation is used, and the system is not under attack.
\cite{ghahremani2011online}
This paper uses the EKF-UI algorithm to jointly estimate the parameters of the motor controller and bus loads.
The original system is a fourth-order nonlinear system of the single motor generator.
The system is assumed to be not under attack.
\cite{ghahremani2011dynamic}
Another EKF-UI paper by the same authors.
\cite{ghahremani2016local}

\item
This paper claims that current WAMS monitoring systems of power grids require calculation of a large Jacobian matrix.
They propose using the UKF to avoid the need for a Jacobian, both improving runtime and accuracy.
\cite{wang2012alternative}

\item
This paper claims that using the UKF to monitor realworld power systems is too slow.
They identify two bottlenecks to a centralized monitor.
First, there is a lot of communication required from every node to the monitor.
Second, the monitor must do a lot of computation.
They solve both problems by partitioning the powergrid into disjoint smaller grids,
filtering each grid independently,
and carefully communicating the results between the smaller grids.
A similar technique might be useful to speed up my solution,
but this is a different idea than I had.
\cite{qing2015decentralized}

This paper also does a distributed analysis of realworld power systems as above.
This paper is more similar to our paper because they are specifically looking to detect faults.
They detect faults in a different way.
We have a specific model of the way faults are generated that we are looking to detect by adding new states to the system.
They do not have a specific model, and instead apply a function to the existing states in an attempt to detect faults.
\cite{rigatos2013distributed}
\end{enumerate}

\item
Methods for generating random power grids
\begin{enumerate}
\item
This paper demonstrates that a number of popular models for generating random graphs do not exhibit the topological and electrical properties of powergrids.
\cite{hines2010topological}

\item
The method is relatively simple and tries to directly model powergrid statistics.
Generates random power grids with the properties of real powergrids up to about 300 buses.
\cite{wang2010generating}

\item
This paper has a more complex method that is suitable for any infrastructure, not just powergrids.
The idea is to model how infrastructure actually develops over time due to realworld constraints.
The paper claims to accurately model nation-sized powergrids (more than 1000 buses).
